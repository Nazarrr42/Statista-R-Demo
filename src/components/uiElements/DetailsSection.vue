          Based on an online survey of over 80,000 medical professionals,
          existing patient satisfaction data, hospital quality metrics and a
          PROMs implementation survey, over 2,300 hospitals in 28 countries were
          awarded for the fifth time in cooperation with Newsweek.

        <p class="text-darkBlue mb-6">
          In addition to the country lists the project provides a list of the
          Top 250 best hospitals worldwide. The global top hospitals were
          determined by the number of international recommendations received in
          the survey and their national rank.
